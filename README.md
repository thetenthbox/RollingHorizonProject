CENG0038: Research Project Submission, Candidate GMRC2

There are three notebooks, with associated data .csv files. 

1. 'researchproject-initialAnalysis' - This contains the preliminary analysis and printing of RH framework policies against the optimal policy. This notebook does not contain uncertainty. This notebook is recommended to read for analysing the code and model
2. 'researchproject-withoutUncertainty' - This notebook contains the set of experiments conducted without uncertainty
3. 'researchproject-uncertainty' - This notebook contains the set of experiments conducted with uncertainty, also contains information on how model forecast errors were translated into error distributions for parameters

The reader should note that these notebooks may contain ad-hoc changes made for analysis that may not be in the final report. The code and settings may vary from what was exactly presented in the report. However, the report does contain information on how to properly replicate the results by simply replacing the appropriate parameter values. 


Thank you!
